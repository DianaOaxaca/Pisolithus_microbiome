Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.6
Cutadapt version: 4.4
Python version: could not detect
Number of cores used for trimming: 12
Quality Phred score cutoff: 15
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 29). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 2)
Adapter sequence: 'CTGTCTCTTATA' (Nextera Transposase sequence; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 250 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed
